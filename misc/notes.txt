1. Generate SAM Table
2. Split table into 3 parts: testing, calibration, blind test
3. Pre-processing/feature reduction by deep learning
4. Training using 1/3 of data, get mathematical model and score for each patient
5. With the score, use the calibration to get ppv probability with the second 1/3 of data
6. Using the last 1/3 of data, generate the Berger table/Users/kenchen/Developer/ipoy/misc/notes.txt

train_x
test_x
train_y
test_y

Take train_x dataset [~750000, 3997] and train_y [~750000, 3]

Files:

- x_test_transformed_SAM_3.csv:
	Transformed x testing data with 10 epoch trial, learning rate 0.0001 (probs too low). Dim
	parameters [3997, 200, 200, 200].
- ip_predicted_ys_10_epoch.csv:
	Predicted y one-hots from 10 epoch trial (same as x_test_transformed_SAM_3.csv above)

- x_test_transformed_SAM_4.csv:
	Transformed x testing data with 20 epoch trial, learning rate 0.001, same dims as before.
- ip_predicted_ys_20_epoch.csv:
	Predicted y one-hots from 20 epoch trial (same trial as above)
